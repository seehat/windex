Windex - For a bright, shiny index
==================================

Windex uses PHP and Apache to style default directory listing index pages. It works directly with Apache's built-in directory mechanism.

Features
--------

* **Styled directory listings.** Windex comes with three lovely themes. Add your own theme by creating another CSS file and linking to in _header.php_.
* **Mobile-optimized view.** Shrink any browser to less than 480 pixels wide and you'll have a theme tailored specifically for mobile devices, perfect for the iPhone.
* **Nice default icons.**
* **Recursive download of directories.** Every directory can be downloaded in desktop view. All files and subdirectories are added to the downloaded zip-file.

Windex themes make liberal use of CSS3. Viewing experiences in legacy browsers may differ.

HEADS UP
--------

**Enabling directory indexes on a live site can be a serious security risk. Be sure to to install Windex only where you want the child files and folders to be viewable.**

Installation
------------

1. Clone the windex repo in a directory on your server and start adding files.

~~~
git clone git@github.com:seehat/windex.git listing.domain.com
~~~

2. Edit windex/config.php and change any configuration options. 

3. Try it out!  Browse to a directory that does not contain an index file.
